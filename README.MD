Python Web API Application using Flask and MariaDB Connector C++ with CQRS (dedicated command and query files) to contact the database. In the future, this may be adapted to use Flask-SQLAlchemy for the backend, but for now executing commands direct to MariaDB is good enough for this project.

The connection info for the database is located in ExecuteDatabaseStatement.py.
